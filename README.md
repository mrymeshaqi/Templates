# Template
## Web Development Exercises
### Project Description:
Welcome to this repository! Here, you'll find a collection of three practice projects designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI design ideas for these projects have been sourced from various websites and used for practice purposes.

### Table of Contents:
This repository includes the following projects:

#### Project 1: Chain

This project is a single-page landing page implemented using HTML, CSS, the grid system, and JavaScript. This template is perfect for those who want to create visually appealing websites with advanced user interfaces, ensuring responsiveness. The template is distinguished by its CSS animations and JavaScript effects that enhance its professional appearance. For example, it features a unique hero header, a sticky navigation bar, animated hover effects, testimonial carousels, a pricing table, an email subscription form, and much more.
#### Project 2: Hostit

Hostit is the first template I coded entirely by myself, encountering several challenges, especially in making it responsive. Some parts of the template, like the slider, are not dynamic since JavaScript was not used.
#### Project 3: FitApp

FitApp is my third professional template, showcasing my CSS and JavaScript skills, particularly in working with the DOM. Features like a sticky and mobile-friendly navigation bar, a newsletter form, and social links with icons make it more appealing to users. It also includes scroll animations, a back-to-top button, and a fun fact counter, giving it a unique look. The responsiveness has been implemented progressively throughout the development of the site. This project is not yet complete, but I will continue to update and improve it over time.ðŸ˜‰
